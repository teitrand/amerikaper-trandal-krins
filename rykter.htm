    <br>Earlier, it was reported that the elderly, quiet Trandal community leader, Mrs. "X" (not her real name) actually
    led a double life: <b>In her youth, way back in 1895, she had been a female stripper at the "Arctic Maiden," a
    notorious �lesund night spot.</b> She was quoted as recently saying, <b>"Those were the days-!!"</b> The story
    should have read "female <u>skipper</u>" not stripper. Apologies are herewith conveyed for any inconvenience this
    error may have caused.<br>
</font></p>

<p>Closer research revealed there never was a nightclub named "Arctic Maiden," but rather it was a <i>boat</i>...
    actually named "<i>Artie's Mermaid</i>," and the year was <i>1958</i>, not 1895. We regret any confusion.</p>

<p>Further, the location was not �lesund, but possibly "<u>Oil-Land</u> Amusement Park," probably in Texas, or in
    Louisiana, or Saudi Arabia, or maybe even somewhere in Norway. "Artie's Mermaid" was apparently the name of a now
    defunct rowboat ride which, the then single Mrs. "X" and her girlfriends enjoyed while on vacation there. Mrs. "X"
    (who, by the way, <u>never</u> lived on Trandal) sat at the tiller steering the rowboat. She was however truthfully
    quoted as saying, <b>"Those were the days-!!"</b></p>
